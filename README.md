# Origami Smart Lamp Mechatronics
Part of [Artisan2.0](https://github.com/openfab-lab/artisan2.0) project   

The body of the lamp is made of [Tyvek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek) paper.   
A laser cut "mold" was made to simplify the folding process on a particle board template. The origami still has to be hand folded, the end result is an organic spherical shape.

Our end goal was to automate the opening and closure of the lamp using light sensors:   
-Low light : flower closed - LED on   
-Bright light : flower open - LED off - (Solar?) Charge mode.
